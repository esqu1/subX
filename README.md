subX
===

This was a Python script I quickly wrote up to create a list of competitors in the WCA database that had sub-7,8,9,10 singles. Ties are sorted by fastest single.

Currently in Python, so script runs a bit slowly.

Using the Script
====
Run in Terminal:

`$ python subX.py <event_name> <time>`


Changelog
====
